## About Me
I am a recent graduate of a Combined Major in Business and Computer Science from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. 

My technical interests lie in the intersection of cloud and systems design. I love complex abstract problems, but am also naturally curious about the internal workings of specific tools. 

## Purpose
As a computer science student, I've come to realize that the vast amount of content I consume on a weekly basis is often too much to retain. My solution is therefore to create a blog that I can use a cental repository of knowledge. My intention is to use this blog to record new technologies and projects that I work with and experiment on. 

I'll be honest I've tried to do blogging in the past, but always lost interest at the phase where I set the blog up. Gatsby and Jekyll were some tools I used in the past to create my blogs. I quickly realized that I was wasting time setting up these sites instead of actually writing content! This current site is my attempt at using a new set of tools to create a blog that will actually be frequently upated with my new learnings. I'm using mkdocs-material to abstract out the creation of the underlying site itself and focussing on the quality of writing in my markdown.
