# Welcome to my Blog :wave:

## About Me :adult:
I am a recent graduate of a Combined Major in Business and Computer Science from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. 

My technical interests lie in the intersection of cloud and systems design. I love complex abstract problems, but am also naturally curious about the internal workings of specific tools. 

## Purpose
As a computer science student, I've come to realize that there is too much information out there. It is way too easy to lose track of all the different tools I've used and learnings I've accumulated. My solution is therefore to create a blog that I can use a cental repository of knowledge. I want to use this blog to record new technologies and projects that I work with and experiment on. 

I'll be honest I've tried to do blogging in the past, but always lost interest at the phase where I set the blog up. I used to hand-code my 'blogs' using programs like Gatsby and Jekyll. However, I quickly realized that I was wasting time setting up these sites instead of actually writing content! This current site is my attempt at using a new set of tools to create a blog that will actually be updated frequently with new learnings. I'm using [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to abstract out the creation of the underlying site itself and focusing on the quality of writing in my markdown.
