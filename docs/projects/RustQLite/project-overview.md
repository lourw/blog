## Background
I stumbled upon this cool repository on Github that contains a ton of resources for building common tools in a step by step fashion. 

I've personally been interested in Database Management Systems and have wondered how they work behind the scenes.

I decided to follow the tutorial with a caveat, instead of following the tutorial step-by-step, I would try to substitute C with Rust instead.
