description: An brief summary of what this project was about

## Background
I stumbled upon this cool [repository](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) on Github that contains a ton of resources for building common tools in a step by step fashion. I've personally been interested in Database Management Systems and have wondered how they work behind the scenes.

The following project is a mock implementation of a database, but using rust instead of C. 

## Project Thoughts
This project is my first committed foray in using rust as a programming language. I realized that this method of following a tutorial in a different language is a fantastic way to learn. I found myself comparing and contrasting different elements of C and rust, while also being able to fall back on the structure that the tutorial provided. For any developer who is looking to expand their repertoire of languages, I highly recommend learning in this fashion. 

Rust provided quite a few unique challenges that forced me to approach problems in a different way. I didn't have free access to points like in C and had to pick up rust's 'ownership' model.
